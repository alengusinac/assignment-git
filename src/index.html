        <h2>What is surfing?</h2>
        <p>
          Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or
          two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section,
          or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer
          towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on
          ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open
          ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave
          pools.
